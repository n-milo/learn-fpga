# Learning FPGA

Working through the examples in (From Blinker to RISC-V)[https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/blob/master/FemtoRV/TUTORIALS/FROM_BLINKER_TO_RISCV/README.md].
Hopefully I can learn enough Verilog to get my (NES emulator)[https://github.com/n-milo/nes] running on an FPGA, though that's a little bit ambitious.

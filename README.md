# Learning FPGA

A mostly-implemented RISC-V CPU in Verilog.

Features:

* All the basics; 32 registers, 5-stage processor, etc.
* Implemented instructions: loads, stores, load immediates, arithmetic, jumps, calls, branches
* Memory-mapped devices: RAM, UART

Future work:

* Go buy a real FPGA and run it
* Compilation from C
* Pipelining

Based off of the tutorial [From Blinker to RISC-V](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/blob/master/FemtoRV/TUTORIALS/FROM_BLINKER_TO_RISCV/README.md).
